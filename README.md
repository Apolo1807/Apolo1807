## ðŸš€ About Me
I started developing softwares in 2020 with Javascript. I use the Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology. My focus lies in learning and teaching with my team.

I carry a good experience in large projects for public administration, using Java and Angular as main tools of development. I have contributed towards the insertion of several implementations, such as fixing bugs of a certain system.
